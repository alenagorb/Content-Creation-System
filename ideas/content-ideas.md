## Building a Content Creation Agent (Without the Budget)

**Raw source:** *I've recently got a new job as a Systems Consultant at an AI-powered data management and automation start-up but it means I have much less time for Substack... the goal of this project is to build me a system which can generate the first draft of my posts from my messing notes but in Savvy Sloth style and language... budget is ideally zero... quality I want decent so I don't have to rewrite the whole thing: just add my jokes and random side thoughts at the end and not spend more than 30 mins-1 hour on the review*

**Pillar:** Workflow Breakdowns | **Type:** Series (4-5 parts)
**Emotional hook:** Practical revelation

### Subtitle
Step-by-step guide to building an AI writing assistant that captures your brand voice and saves hours of editing time.

### Opening Hook
I've got a new job that leaves me with roughly zero time for Substack. That's a problem because I didn't want to give it up. So I did what any automation-obsessed person would do: I built a system to write my posts for me.

The catch? It needed to sound like me. Not some generic AI. My actual voice with all the sarcasm and random side thoughts.

---

### LinkedIn Angles (2-3)

**Angle 1 — The Philosophy**
Hook: "Not every problem needs an AI solution. But some problems absolutely do."
Core point: When you're time-poor but don't want to abandon something you love, AI can help you keep it going without sacrificing quality.
Engagement question: "What side project have you almost given up due to time? Could AI help you keep it alive?"

**Angle 2 — The Number**
Hook: "I went from spending 4 hours per post to 30 minutes. Here's how."
Core point: The real ROI isn't just time saved—it's maintaining your creative presence when life gets busy.
Engagement question: "How much time do you spend on content creation? What's the biggest time sink for you?"

**Angle 3 — The Contrast**
Hook: "What social media tells you: AI will replace writers. What actually happened: AI helped me keep writing."
Core point: The narrative around AI replacing creatives misses the nuance—sometimes AI augments rather than replaces.
Engagement question: "What's your take: is AI replacing creativity or enabling it?"

### Substack Notes Angles (3-5)

- The emotional moment of realizing you need to automate your own content because life changed (relatable, vulnerable)
- Quick tip: "I used 3 core prompts to make this work: transform notes → generate post → adapt for LinkedIn" (casual, practical)
- The frustration of trying to get AI to sound like you specifically (self-deprecating humor)
- Philosophical thought: "I'm using AI to help people use AI to create content about using AI" (reflective, slightly meta)
- Ask: "Anyone else building content systems for themselves? Would love to compare notes."

### Subtitle
How I built a Claude skill that reads my brand guidelines and transforms chaotic automation notes into structured content briefs.

### Opening Hook
My Notion was a mess. Wall of text, half-formed ideas, numbers scattered everywhere, emotional reactions mixed with technical details. Trying to turn that into a coherent Substack post was taking hours I didn't have.

So I built something that could do it for me.

---

### LinkedIn Angles (2-3)

**Angle 1 — The Lesson**
Hook: "The biggest lesson from building my content system? Don't give agents access to your APIs."
Core point: Sometimes the low-tech solution (MD files) beats the sophisticated one for reliability and peace of mind.
Engagement question: "What's your approach to letting AI agents access your systems?"

**Angle 2 — The Number**
Hook: "It took me 3 days to build a system that saves me 3+ hours per post."
Core point: The upfront investment in building systems pays off quickly when you have limited time.
Engagement question: "What's your time-to-save ratio on automation projects?"

**Angle 3 — The Question**
Hook: "How do you capture your messy ideas? And more importantly—how do you find them later?"
Core point: The real problem isn't generating content, it's capturing and organizing raw material in a way that retrieval works.
Engagement question: "What's your system for capturing ideas?"

---

### Substack Notes Angles (3-5)

- "The moment I realised I was overcomplicating things: trying to use LinkedIn API for analytics when manual export takes 5 minutes" (self-deprecating, practical)
- "Claude deleted half my Notion pages. Thank the coding gods for restore functionality" (failure, vulnerability)
- "Sometimes the low-tech solution is the right intermediary solution" (philosophy)
- "I'm now using AI to help people use AI to create content about using AI" (meta observation, wry)
- Quick framework: "3 prompts: transform → generate → adapt"

## Discovering Gemini Gems for Brand Documentation

**Raw source:** *discovered gemini gems can be used to create or even come up with brand guides and documentation... built a complete system that analyses writing samples and derives voice patterns, formatting preferences, content pillars... the gem asks for 2-3 writing samples and 4 basic questions then intelligently derives everything else*

**Pillar:** Tool Reviews | **Type:** Standalone
**Emotional hook:** Practical revelation

---

### Title Options

1. ⭐ **I Used Gemini to Generate My Brand Guidelines in 20 Minutes** — Surprising outcome + specific time comparison that validates the approach
2. **Creating Brand Documentation Without the Headache: A New Approach**
3. **From Writing Samples to Brand Strategy: An AI-Powered Method**

### Subtitle
How I discovered Gemini Gems can extract your brand voice from writing samples and automatically generate the documentation most creators skip.

### Opening Hook
It took me 2 days (on and off) just thinking about my audience, goals, and voice for Savvy Sloth. Most creators never do this exercise because it feels like homework.

Then I discovered Gemini Gems could do it in 20 minutes.

---

### LinkedIn Angles (2-3)

**Angle 1 — The Lesson**
Hook: "Most AI content guides assume you already have brand docs. That's the hard part."
Core point: The real barrier isn't using AI—it's having the strategic foundation for AI to work with. But AI can now help create that foundation too.
Engagement question: "Do you have documented brand guidelines? How long did they take to create?"

**Angle 2 — The Philosophy**
Hook: "Most creators have their voice in their writing, not in documented guidelines."
Core point: The irony is that AI can extract what we can't easily articulate—it learns from our actual output rather than our theoretical descriptions.
Engagement question: "How would you describe your brand voice? Can you point to specific examples?"

**Angle 3 — The Number**
Hook: "20 hours vs 20 minutes: I tested AI-generated brand docs."
Core point: The quality isn't perfect but it's a starting point that would take most people weeks to create from scratch.
Engagement question: "Would you trust AI-generated brand strategy? What's missing?"

---

### Substack Notes Angles (3-5)

- "Built 5 knowledge files from my writing samples in 20 minutes vs the 20 hours it would've taken manually" (numbers, practical)
- "Pro tip: don't use Deep Research or Thinking setting - the models overcomplicate things" (tip, experiential)
- "Custom GPT requires a paid subscription but Gemini Gems is free. Here's the trade-off I made." (comparison, practical)
- "I packaged this into a Gem so others can replicate the process" (generous, useful)
- Ask: "Want me to share the Gem? Would anyone actually use this?" (engagement)

### SEO Notes
**Primary keyword:** Gemini Gems
**Secondary keywords:** brand guidelines, AI content creation, brand voice

## The Meta Observation: AI About AI About AI

**Raw source:** *interesting meta observation: i'm now using ai to help people use ai to create content about using ai. does look like we're getting lost in this AI matrix but also it's genuinely solving a real problem - most creators have their voice in their writing, not in documented guidelines. extracting that voice automatically is valuable*

**Pillar:** Transparency | **Type:** Standalone (LinkedIn/Note focus)
**Emotional hook:** Wry frustration

---

### Title Options

1. ⭐ **I'm Using AI to Help People Use AI to Create Content About Using AI** — The full meta loop as the title, captures the absurdity directly
2. **The AI Matrix is Real: A Confession**
3. **Building AI Systems for AI Content: Is This Helpful or Insane?**

### Subtitle
A candid reflection on whether automating AI content creation is solving a real problem or just adding to the noise.

### Opening Hook
Here's a fun one: I'm now using AI to help people use AI to create content about using AI.

At some point, you have to ask—is this genuinely useful? Or are we just building robots to make more robots?

---

### LinkedIn Angles (2-3)

**Angle 1 — The Philosophy**
Hook: "The question isn't whether AI will replace jobs. It's whether we'll learn to use it well enough to stay relevant."
Core point: The meta-layer (AI helping with AI content) seems absurd until you realize most creators don't have time to document their voice—that's the real problem being solved.
Engagement question: "Are we building useful tools or just complex solutions to self-created problems?"

**Angle 2 — The Contrast**
Hook: "What this looks like: me building an AI system to help people create AI content. What this actually is: helping creators capture their voice when they don't have time to document it."
Core point: Strip away the meta-layer and the core value is simple: helping people who write actually write less while staying true to their voice.
Engagement question: "Does this help or harm creative authenticity?"

**Angle 3 — The Question**
Hook: "When does helping people use AI become enabling AI dependency?"
Core point: There's a line between using AI as a tool and outsourcing your thinking. The difference matters.
Engagement question: "Where do you draw the line with AI assistance?"

---

### Substack Notes Angles (3-5)

- "I'm in the AI matrix. Someone get me out." (wry, self-aware)
- "The thing is, it actually solves a real problem. That's what makes it worth doing despite the absurdity." (defensive, explanatory)
- "Most creators have their voice in their writing, not in documented guidelines. Extracting that automatically? Valuable." (insight)
- "Is this helpful or am I just overcomplicating everything?" (genuine question, vulnerable)

---

### SEO Notes
**Primary keyword:** AI content creation
**Secondary keywords:** brand voice, AI tools, creativity
**Search intent:** Philosophical exploration of AI in content creation
**Keyword in title:** ❌ (title is too meta-focused, would need rewording for SEO)

## Choosing OpenCode: A Software Selection Story

**Raw source:** *I was debating which software to use for agents: most people seem to really like Claude Code, but you don't get a free tier and have to pay. I'm not ready to commit. OpenClaw is just scary from the security point of view so I didn't even touch that. Codex you also gotta pay. OpenCode seemed like the best free alternative*

**Pillar:** Tool Reviews | **Type:** Standalone
**Emotional hook:** Practical revelation

---

### Title Options

1. ⭐ **Choosing an AI Coding Assistant When You Don't Want to Pay: My Decision** — Practical focus + the constraint (free) upfront makes it relatable
2. **Claude Code vs OpenCode: What I Chose (And Why)**
3. **Free AI Agents Tested: Finding the Right Tool for Content Automation**

### Subtitle
I tested OpenCode, Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Codex so you don't have to. Here's what mattered in my decision.

### Opening Hook
Most people really like Claude Code. But you have to pay for it. And I'm not ready to commit to a subscription for something I'm still testing.

OpenClaw scared me from a security perspective. Codex also requires payment. OpenCode seemed like the best free alternative.

---

### LinkedIn Angles (2-3)

**Angle 1 — The Lesson**
Hook: "The right tool isn't always the most popular one. It's the one that fits your actual constraints."
Core point: Claude Code might be brilliant but if you won't pay for it, it's useless to you. OpenCode's free tier let me actually test the approach before investing.
Engagement question: "What's your criteria for choosing AI tools? Is free a requirement for you?"

**Angle 2 — The Number**
Hook: "I tested 4 different AI coding assistants in a week. Here's the winner for free-tier users."
Core point: The decision came down to basic economics: free access trumps features I can't afford to use.
Engagement question: "What's your experience with Claude Code? Is the free tier enough?"

**Angle 3 — The Philosophy**
Hook: "Sometimes the low-tech solution is the right intermediary solution."
Core point: Rather than fighting with unofficial APIs for LinkedIn/Substack, manual export is easier now. Build the sophistication later when you need it.
Engagement question: "When do you choose manual over automated? What's your threshold?"

---

### Substack Notes Angles (3-5)

- "OpenCode vs Claude Code: here's why I went with free over features" (practical, comparison)
- "Security first: I didn't even try OpenClaw because the permissions scared me off" (transparency, cautionary)
- "Might try a local Ollama model for an experiment to avoid paying" (future experiment, open)
- "Some people on Reddit didn't like that OpenCode doesn't constantly ask for permissions - not sure how true this is" (question, social proof)

### SEO Notes
**Primary keyword:** OpenCode
**Secondary keywords:** Claude Code, AI coding assistant, free AI tools

## Ideas Summary

**Total ideas processed:** 5
**Ideas extracted:** 5

### Pillar Balance

| Pillar | Target | This Batch |
|---|---|---|
| AI Experiments | 30% | 20% |
| Workflow Breakdowns | 30% | 20% |
| Tool Reviews | 25% | 40% |
| Transparency | 15% | 20% |

**Balance note:** Tool Reviews is slightly over-represented (40% vs 25% target) due to two standalone tool-focused ideas (Gemini Gems, OpenCode selection). This is fine for an initial batch but future notes should emphasize more AI Experiments and Workflow Breakdown content for better balance.

### Series vs Standalone
- Full series: 2 (Content Creation Agent, ideas-transformer skill)
- Standalone posts: 3 (Gemini Gems, Meta observation, OpenCode selection)
- Supporting pieces: 0

### Scheduling Suggestion
Based on the publication cadence (1 Substack/week, 2-3 LinkedIn/week, 1-3 Notes/day), this batch covers approximately 4 weeks of Substack content and 6-9 weeks of LinkedIn content.

**Priority order for scheduling:**
1. **Content Creation Agent** — This is the most relatable and practical series, addresses a common pain point (time scarcity), and establishes the system behind Savvy Sloth transparently
2. **ideas-transformer skill** — Builds on the first series, shows the methodology, strong AI Experiments angle
3. **Gemini Gems discovery** — Standalone that's timely and useful for other creators, good for variety
4. **OpenCode selection** — Tool comparison that helps the audience make their own decisions, standalone for variety
5. **Meta observation** — Philosophical piece that can run anytime, good for thought leadership

### Gaps & Suggestions
- **AI Experiments underrepresented:** The batch has more Tool Review content than expected. Future notes should capture more tool testing, prompt experiments, and integration testing to hit the 30% target.
- **Workflow Breakdowns gap:** Only one full series. Consider capturing more "how I built X" type notes to reach the 30% target.
- **Note:** The Meta observation piece is philosophical and could work well as LinkedIn thought leadership rather than Substack, which helps diversify platform content.
