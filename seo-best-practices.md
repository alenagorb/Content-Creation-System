## Substack SEO Strategy

### Understanding Substack's Discovery Ecosystem

**How People Find Substack Content:**
1. **Substack's internal search** (within app and web)
2. **Google search** (Substack posts are indexed)
3. **Social media shares** (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit)
4. **Substack recommendations** (algorithmic and manual)
5. **Direct links and referrals**

**Substack's Algorithm Factors:**
- Subscriber engagement (opens, reads, likes, comments)
- Reader retention (how much of the post is read)
- Sharing and restacking activity
- Post frequency and consistency
- New subscriber growth rate

### Title Optimisation for Substack

**Character Limits**
- Optimal length: 50-70 characters (for full display in feeds)
- Maximum for full Google preview: 60 characters
- Can go longer for compelling titles (up to 100 chars) if early words are strong

**Title Formula**

**Format 1: Problem + Solution**
- "From [Problem] to [Solution]: [Method/Tool]"
- Example: "From Visual Systems to Pinterest Boards: n8n Workflow for Automated Pin Creation"

**Format 2: Transparency/Lessons**
- "Why [Action] Failed (And [What Worked Instead])"
- Example: "Why My 'Perfect' Setup Collapsed in Production (And the Simple Fix)"

**Format 3: Specific How-To**
- "[Action]: [Specific Tool/Method] for [Outcome]"
- Example: "Building an AI Content Pipeline: Zapier + Gemini for Pharma News Tracking"

**Format 4: Curiosity + Specifics**
- "[Surprising Claim/Number]: [Specific Topic]"
- Example: "8 Hours Lost: Pinterest API Workarounds That Actually Work"

**Title Best Practices**
- **Include primary keyword** in first 50 characters
- **Be specific** over clever: "n8n Workflow Setup" instead of "My Automation Journey Part 3"
- **Use numbers** when relevant: "3 Pinterest API Alternatives" or "Part 4:"
- **Include tool names** that people search for: n8n, Make, Zapier, Claude
- **Front-load value**: Put the most important words first
- **Avoid clickbait**: Be intriguing but honest

**Primary Keywords to Target (Based on Niche)**
- AI automation
- Workflow automation
- n8n tutorial
- Make vs Zapier
- AI tool review
- Automation testing
- No-code automation
- AI integration guide
- Productivity automation
- ChatGPT workflows

### Subtitle/Description Optimisation

**Purpose**
- Appears in Substack search results and social shares
- Provides additional context for SEO
- Helps readers decide whether to click

**Best Practices**
- **Length:** 120-160 characters for optimal preview
- **Include secondary keywords** not in title
- **Clarify the value:** What will readers learn/gain?
- **Match reader search intent:** Use language your audience uses
- **Example:** "Step-by-step guide to automated AI image generation and Pin creation for visual brand system testing."

### Content Structure for SEO

**Header Hierarchy**
- H1: Title only (Substack handles this)
- H2: Major sections with keyword variations
- H3: Subsections with long-tail keywords
- Example H2: "Workflow 2: Daily Pin Creation" (includes "workflow" keyword)
- Example H3: "Node 8a: If Approved, Upload Pin to Pinterest with LATE API" (includes "Pinterest API" and "LATE API" keywords)

**First 100 Words Matter**
- Include primary keyword naturally (don’t force it though)
- Set clear expectations for post content
- Hook readers to keep reading (engagement signals)
- Example: "We're already on part 3 of my automated visual system testing engine. And this is where things really get interesting."

**Keyword Density**
- Primary keyword: 2-3 times (title, early paragraph, one subheader)
- Secondary keywords: 1-2 times each
- Avoid keyword stuffing (reads unnaturally)
- Focus on natural language and reader value

**Internal Linking**
- Link to previous posts in series: "In part 1, we covered..."
- Link to related topics: "If you haven't set up n8n yet, check out my guide"
- Use descriptive anchor text: "my n8n setup guide", not "click here"
- Helps readers discover older content
- Signals to search engines about topic relationships

**External Linking**
- Link to official documentation (builds authority)
- Link to tools mentioned (n8n docs, API docs, etc.)
- Credit sources for data or quotes
- Link to posts of other creators whose ideas might’ve been used: "Check out @AI Meets Girls Boss’s post to learn more about …" 
- Opens in a new tab for tools/resources (keeps readers on your post)

### Image SEO

**File Naming**
- Use descriptive names: `n8n-pinterest-workflow-diagram.png`
- Include keywords: `automated-pin-creation-setup.jpg`
- Avoid generic: `IMG_1234.png` or `screenshot.png`

**Alt Text**
- Describe image content accurately: "The n8n workflow canvas showing Pinterest board creation with highlighted data flow between nodes"
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Help visually impaired readers (accessibility)
- 100-125 characters is optimal

**Image Optimisation**
- Use PNG format when possible (better quality)
- Aim for <500KB per image
- Hero images can be larger (up to 1MB)

### Content Length & Depth

**Optimal Post Length by Type**

**Deep-Dive Technical Guides**
- 2,000-3,500 words
- Comprehensive, implementable
- Ranks for long-tail keywords
- Example: n8n workflow setup guides

**Tool Reviews & Comparisons**
- 1,500-2,500 words
- Detailed enough for decision-making
- Includes pros/cons, use cases, pricing
- Example: "LATE API vs Pinterest API"

**Thought Leadership/Philosophy**
- 800-1,500 words
- Focused on a single insight
- Backed by personal experience
- Example: "Not every problem needs an AI solution"

**Updates & Announcements**
- 500-1,000 words
- Quick, actionable
- Links to related deeper content
- Example: "Pollinations.ai API Changes"

**Depth Factors That Improve SEO**
- Answer the complete question (don't leave gaps)
- Include examples, screenshots, and code blocks
- Cover edge cases and troubleshooting
- Provide next steps and resources
- Update posts when tools/methods change

### Topic Clustering Strategy

**Core Pillar Content**
- Create comprehensive guides on major topics
- Example: "Complete Guide to n8n for AI Automation"
- 3,000-5,000 words, covers breadth

**Cluster Content (Supporting Posts)**
- Deep dives into specific aspects of the pillar topic
- Example: "n8n Error Handling Best Practices"
- Link back to pillar content
- Link between related cluster posts

**Savvy Sloth Topic Clusters**

**Cluster 1: n8n Automation**
- Pillar: "n8n Complete Guide" (future)

### Freshness & Updates

**Update Older Posts When:**

**How to Update for SEO**
- Add "Updated [Date]:" note at top

**Substack Update Best Practice**

- Mention update in Substack Notes
- Link to updated post from new related content

### Metadata & Tags

**Substack Sections**

- Examples: "n8n Tutorials", "Tool Reviews", "AI Experiments"
- Helps readers navigate by interest
- Creates topical authority

## LinkedIn SEO Strategy

### Understanding LinkedIn's Algorithm

**What LinkedIn Prioritises:**
1. **Dwell time:** How long people spend reading your post
2. **Engagement velocity:** Quick likes/comments signal quality
3. **Conversation depth:** Replies to comments boost reach
4. **Profile authority:** Connections, followers, prior engagement
5. **Relevance:** LinkedIn's AI predicts who'll engage based on content

**LinkedIn Does NOT Prioritise:**
- External links (actually penalise them in initial distribution)
- Hashtags in post body (use at the end only)
- Overly promotional content
- Posts without a clear value proposition

### LinkedIn Post Optimisation

**Hook Optimisation (First 1-2 Lines)**

**Character Limit**
- First ~140 characters appear before "See more"
- These characters determine whether people expand post

**Hook Formulas That Work**

**Personal Story Opening**
- "Yesterday at a local coffee shop, my AI-obsessed brain kicked into overdrive."
- "I lost ~8 hours rebuilding an automation because my 'perfect' setup collapsed in production."

**Contrarian Statement**
- "Not every 'problem' needs an AI solution."
- "AI doesn't just decide to flood the internet with low-effort content. We do."

**Surprising Outcome**
- "I spent 40 minutes creating ONE AI headshot (not the '1-minute' you see online)."
- "After 5 hours filming a demo video, Pinterest rejected my API access in 2 hours."

**What Happened vs What They Tell You**
- "What social media tells you happens: 'I made a perfect headshot in 1 minute with AI for FREE!'"
- "What actually happened: [detailed reality]"

**Hook Testing**
- A/B test different hooks for similar content
- Monitor which hooks get higher initial engagement
- Refine based on data (LinkedIn analytics)

### Content Structure for LinkedIn

**Optimal Post Length**
- Short-form (high engagement): 150-300 words
- Medium-form (thought leadership): 300-500 words
- Long-form (deep dives): 500-800 words (rare, use for exceptional insights)

**Formatting for Readability**
- **Line breaks** between thoughts (not wall of text)
- **Bullets or arrows (→)** for key points
- **Spacing** for visual breathing room
- **Emoji** (1-2 total, not in professional sections)
- **No CAPS or bold text** (LinkedIn doesn’t allow this)

**Value-First Structure**
1. Hook (1-2 lines)
2. Context/story (2-3 short paragraphs)
3. Key insights (bullets or numbered)
4. Lesson/conclusion (1-2 paragraphs)
5. Engagement question (1 line)
6. Hashtags (3-5)

### Hashtag Strategy

**Hashtag Research**
- Check what hashtags industry leaders use
- Look at competitor posts in your niche
- Use LinkedIn search to find popular tags
- Mix broad and niche hashtags

**Savvy Sloth Hashtag Tiers**

**Broad (100K+ followers)**
- #AIAutomation
- #NoCode
- #ProductivityHacks
- #AITools
- #ContentCreation

**Mid-Tier (10K-100K followers)**
- #n8n
- #Zapier
- #Make
- #AutomationWorkflow
- #AIIntegration

**Niche (1K-10K followers)**
- #n8nAutomation
- #MakeAutomation
- #AITesting
- #WorkflowDesign
- #AutomationROI

**Hashtag Best Practices**
- Use 3-5 hashtags per post
- Place at end of post (not in body)
- Mix one broad + 2-3 mid-tier + 1 niche
- Don't use the same hashtags every time (appears spammy)
- Create a custom hashtag for the brand (#SavvySloth) for findability

**Example Hashtag Combinations**

**For Technical Deep-Dive Post:**
#AIAutomation #n8n #WorkflowDesign #NoCode #AutomationTesting

**For Thought Leadership Post:**
#AITools #ProductivityHacks #TechWithPurpose #AutomationStrategy #AIEthics

**For Tool Comparison Post:**
#Zapier #Make #n8n #NoCodeComparison #AutomationPlatforms

### Engagement Optimisation

**When to Post**
- Test different times
- Generally: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM (your timezone)
- Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons
- Use LinkedIn analytics to find your audience's active times

**Engagement Tactics**
- Reply to every comment in the first 2 hours (boosts algorithm)
- Ask questions that prompt discussion
- Tag relevant people/companies (sparingly)
- Like and reply to comments on your post
- Engage with others' content daily (30 min)

**Comment Strategy**
- Post thoughtful comments on industry posts
- Add new insights, not just "Great post!"
- Comment on posts from larger accounts (visibility)
- Respond to comments on your posts substantively

### Link Strategy for LinkedIn

**Primary Approach: Link in Comments**
- Post valuable content in the main post
- Add link in first comment
- Better algorithm performance (links in body suppress reach)
- Encourage "Check the link in comments"

**When to Link in Post Body**
- Sharing newsletter post (that's the point)
- Linking to the tool/resource being discussed
- If the link is critical to understanding the content

**Link Formatting**
- Use LinkedIn's link preview feature
- Ensure preview shows compelling image and text
- Edit preview text if the default isn't compelling

- Behind-the-scenes struggles
- Surprising data points
- Philosophical takeaways
- Questions for the community

**Future Medium Post (Optional)**
- Combine series into a single comprehensive guide

- Optimise for different keywords
- Link back to Substack for updates

### Social Sharing Optimisation

**When Sharing Substack Posts**
- Write a native LinkedIn post, don't just paste a link
- Include key insight in the post itself
- Add "Read the full breakdown: [link]"
- Use a compelling hook even in a sharing post

**When Sharing on BlueSky (Future)**
- Create a thread with key points
