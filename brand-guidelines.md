# Brand Guidelines

## Writing Style

### Voice Characteristics

**Honest & Transparent**
- Always share the full picture: time invested, costs incurred, failures encountered
- Never exaggerate results or oversimplify complex processes
- Call out when something takes longer than expected or costs more than anticipated
- Example: "It took me 40 minutes and 5 different tools to get one AI headshot, not the '1-minute magic' social media promises"

**Practical & Results-Focused**
- Lead with actionable insights and concrete outcomes
- Include specific metrics: time saved, costs, error rates, actual ROI
- Prioritise "here's how to do it" over "here's an interesting idea"
- Always include SPECIFIC numbers: "6-8 hours" not "several hours", "£0" not "free/cheap"
- Break down time by activity: writing first draft, AI editing rounds, formatting, images
- Example: "This workflow saves 3.5 hours per week and costs $12/month in API fees"

**Accessible Technical Writing**
- Assume intermediate technical comfort but explain advanced concepts
- Use analogies to clarify complex ideas
- Break down jargon without being condescending
- Example: "Think of vector embeddings like a filing system for your AI's memory"

**Relatable & Self-Aware**
- Share personal struggles and mistakes openly
- Use self-deprecating humour to builda  connection
- Acknowledge when you're figuring things out alongside the reader
- Example: "Alena, read the docs before you install!!"

**Curious & Experimental**
- Approach problems with genuine interest, not prescriptive solutions
- Test unconventional approaches and share what you learn
- Encourage reader experimentation while being realistic about the effort required
- Example: "Let's find out together" rather than "Here's what you must do"

### Sentence Structure

**Length Variation**
- Mix short, punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Short sentences for impact: "But not all was lost."
- Longer sentences for detail: "After some faffing around with the configurations from the LATE Pinterest docs, I finally came up with the following setup."
- Average: 15-25 words per sentence
- Break up any sentence over 35 words unless rhythm demands it

**Paragraph Construction**
- Standard length: 2-4 sentences
- Break up dense technical sections into 1-2 sentence paragraphs for breathing room
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis or transition
- Example from posts: "Phew… that was a packed one, but we're in the home stretch, folks!"

**Opening Strategies**
- Start with context or scene-setting: "Yesterday at a local coffee shop..."
- Begin with the problem: "I lost ~8 hours rebuilding an automation..."
- Lead with a relatable struggle: "I don't really like the term 'AI slop'."
- Hook with curiosity: "We're already on part 3 of my automated visual system testing engine. And this is where things really get interesting."

### Use of Humor

**When to Use**
- To lighten technical complexity
- When describing personal failures or frustrations
- To build rapport with readers
- When pointing out industry absurdities

**How to Deploy**
- Self-deprecating observations about your own process
- Playful commentary on unexpected outcomes
- Emoji for tone (but sparingly, see Emoji Guidelines)
- Example: "And yes, you now need a Pollinations.ai API key to generate images. What can I say, another week, another heartbreak 💔."

**What to Avoid**
- Sarcasm that might read as mean-spirited
- Jokes at others' expense
- Humour that undermines the practical value being delivered
- Overuse that makes content feel unserious
- Any inappropriate or discriminatory jokes or comments

### Story Elements

**Personal Anecdotes**
- Share real experiences from your automation journey
- Include specific details (time of day, emotions felt, exact errors encountered)
- Connect personal stories to universal pain points
- Example: "Five hours and countless retakes later, I happily submitted my video to Pinterest, who emailed me back two hours later saying 'Nope' 🫠."

**Unexpected Outcomes**
- Highlight when things don't go as planned
- Show the pivot or workaround discovered
- Make failures educational rather than just entertaining
- Example: "Originally, I planned to stick with the Sandbox option for this project and leave it there. But the curiosity got the better of me..."

**Behind-the-Scenes Glimpses**
- Show the messy reality of building automations
- Include dead ends and false starts
- Reveal your thought process and decision-making
- Example: "My AI-obsessed brain immediately started optimising: demand forecasting, inventory algorithms, revenue models..."

### Technical Depth

**Baseline Assumption**
- The reader is comfortable with technology but not necessarily a developer
- They understand concepts like APIs, integrations, workflows
- They may need an explanation of specific technical terms
- They want enough detail to implement, not just understand conceptually

**When to Go Deep**
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Troubleshooting specific errors
- Explaining why one tool choice is better than another
- Configuration details that readers will need to replicate

**When to Stay High-Level**
- Introductory sections and context-setting
- Philosophical discussions about automation
- Quick tips and Substack Notes
- LinkedIn posts (unless specifically for a technical audience)

**Explanation Strategies**
- Define technical terms inline on first use
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Show examples alongside explanations
- Provide links to documentation for deeper dives

## Language & Grammar

### Spelling

- Use British English spelling throughout, e.g., "optimise" instead of "optimize", "colour" instead of "color"

### Regional Expressions

- Use British English regional expressions occasionally to vary the language, e.g., faffing around,  knackered, dodgy
- Can use other regional expressions if appropriate, e.g., "This one is a doozy!", or "Grab a cuppa."

### Punctuation

- Never use em dashes "—": use a comma or a hyphen instead
- Always use the Oxford comma when listing items
- Use semi-colons very sparingly, only when the sentence cannot be broken into two
- Use exclamation marks to express excitement or emphasise a point, but not excessively

### Language Preferences

- Use collaborative and active language over passive, e.g., "we’ll discuss how …" vs "this post will discuss how …"
- Use first person ("I") over third person or passive voice when describing what was done by the author, e.g., "I want to share one tip from a LinkedIn commenter" 
- Add side comments, quick thoughts or additional information in parentheses (), e.g., "I only tried the Access Token approach, but OAuth does seem to be a bit more straightforward at first glance (if you know what you’re doing)."

### What to Avoid

-  AI writing telltale signs, e.g., rule of 3, "X, not Y" expressions, excessive use of white spaces, line breaks and short sentences
- Unprofessional, rude, or potentially disparaging or discriminatory language or expressions  


## Formatting Rules

### Headers & Structure

**Substack Newsletter Headers**
- H1: Post title only (written in title case)
- H2: Major sections (e.g., "Workflow 1: Pinterest Board Creation")
- H3: Subsections (e.g., "Node 1: Manual Trigger")
- H4: Rare; use only when a deeply nested structure is necessary

**Header Naming Conventions**
- Use descriptive, actionable headers: "Running n8n Locally", not just "Setup"
- Include key information: "Workaround 1: LATE API in n8n", not just "Workaround 1"
- Number series parts and workflow steps for clarity
- Make headers scannable for readers skimming

### Lists & Bullet Points

**When to Use Lists**
- Configuration details (multiple settings to specify)
- Step-by-step instructions
- Multiple related items (pain points, metrics, tools)
- Quick reference sections (prerequisites, metrics)

**When to Use Prose Instead**
- Explanations and context-setting
- Storytelling sections
- Philosophical discussions
- Transitions and conclusions

**List Formatting**
- Use bullets (•) for unordered lists
- Use numbers for sequential steps
- Nested bullets: Use - or sub-bullets sparingly
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Example of parallel structure:
  - "Make sure you have..."
  - "Check if they are..."
  - "Reboot after the..."

### Emphasis & Formatting

**Bold Text**
- Key terms on first mention: "**Standard Access** API"
- Important warnings or notes: "**A word of caution:**"
- Section labels in lists: "**Purpose:** Allows you to..."
- Critical action items: "**Make sure you...**"

**Italic Text**
- Emphasis within sentences: "That's *really* what matters"
- Internal voice or thoughts: "*Alena, read the docs before you install!!*"
- Book/tool names when not linking: Avoid generally; use plain text or bold

**Code Formatting**
- Inline code: Use backticks for `variable_names`, `API endpoints`, `file_paths`
- Code blocks: Use fenced code blocks with language specification
```json
{
  "example": "code block"
}
```
- Commands: Format as code blocks or inline code: `npm install -g package`

**Links**
- Link text should be descriptive: "n8n docs for latest guidance" not "click here"
- Link brand names on first mention when relevant
- Use markdown links: [text](url)
- For visual context, sometimes link to the URL in prose: https://example.com

### Visual Elements

**Images**
- Include screenshots for complex technical steps
- Use workflow diagrams to show system architecture
- Show before/after examples when relevant
- Create tool or price comparison tables where appropriate
- Add alt text describing the image content
- Caption screenshots with context: "The LATE dashboard showing social media integration options..."

**Emoji Usage**
- 🦥 is the signature brand emoji (use in sign-offs or brand moments)
- Use sparingly elsewhere (1-2 per post maximum in body)
- 🫠 for limited time/struggles: "Only 30 minutes before I need to crash 🫠"
- 😭 for frustrations: "Five hours and countless retakes later… 😭"
- 😅 for self-aware acknowledgments: "My husband thinks I'm crazy 😅"
- Appropriate contexts: self-deprecating moments 🫠, excitement 🥳, struggles 😭
- Avoid in professional sections or technical instructions
- Never use as bullet points or list markers

**Parenthetical Asides**
- Use frequently to add colour, side thoughts, quick asides
- Example: "I spend 6-8 hours on a post (yes, really, my husband thinks I'm crazy)"
- Example: "It's brilliant (most days)."
- Add personal colour rather than just information

**Callout Boxes/Highlights**
- Use italicised notes for helpful asides: "*To help you get started faster...*"
- Use bold for warnings: "**Make sure you...**"
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections
- Keep visual breaks consistent throughout content

### Quotes & Citations

**When to Quote**
- Exact error messages or code output
- Specific configuration values that must be precise
- Direct citations from documentation

**How to Format Quotes**
- Use blockquotes (>) for pull quotes or longer citations
- Use inline code formatting for exact values: `"APPROVE|DECLINE"`
- Attribute sources when quoting others' insights

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Substack Newsletter

**Experiment Series Structure**
- Every 4-5 posts covering one experiment are grouped in a series
- Each series roughly follows the following structure:
	- Part 1: the main pain point, project goals, high-level solution overview, and the tool stack for the project
  - Part 2: in-depth workflow architecture overview, additional considerations for the tool choices where appropriate
  - Part 3: problems encountered during the project + fixes; can include discussions about changing specific APIs, tools, or automation platforms altogether
  - Part 4: time and cost savings of the automation vs manual execution; can include incremental ROI, payback period, and value of time saved calculations
  - Part 5 (usually paywalled): full blueprint with all workflow templates, prompts, scripts,troubleshooting guidance, etc. 
- Exact series structure and length could vary depending on the project outcomes and whether there is a paid post or not 

**Optimal Length**
- Standard post: 1,500-2,500 words
- Deep technical guides: 2,000-3,500 words
- Quick updates or announcements: 800-1,200 words

**Opening Style**
- Start with context or hook
- Include a brief recap if part of a series
- Set expectations for what's covered
- Example: "We're already on part 3 of my automated visual system testing engine. And this is where things really get interesting."

**Structure**
- Introduction (what we're covering today)
- Main content (3-5 major sections)
- Next steps or conclusion
- Call to action
- Signature sign-off

**CTA Placement**
- End of every post: subscribe, share, join chat
- After delivering value (never before establishing credibility)
- Natural integration into closing thoughts
- Example: "If you want to follow along (and learn what actually works in AI automation), subscribe below and share with friends and colleagues who might enjoy this experiment."

**Image Usage**
- Hero image at top (AI-generated sloth themed to post topic)
- Technical screenshots throughout (with captions)
- Workflow diagrams for complex architectures
- Before/after comparisons when relevant
- Tool/price comparison tables when relevant

**Signature Sign-Off**
```

### LinkedIn

**Character Limits**
- Optimal length: 150-300 words
- Hook in first 1-2 lines (appears before "See more")
- Can go longer for in-depth thought leadership (400-500 words max)

**Hook Strategies**
- Contrarian opener: "Not every 'problem' needs an AI solution."
- Unexpected story: "Yesterday at a local coffee shop, my AI-obsessed brain kicked into overdrive."
- Struggle narrative: "I lost ~8 hours rebuilding an automation because my 'perfect' setup collapsed in production."
- What vs Actually format: "What social media tells you happens:" vs "What actually happened:"

**Formatting**
- Use line breaks for readability (not dense paragraphs)
- Bullet points with → or • for key insights
- No bold/caps (LinkedIn limits formatting)
- Strategic emoji use (1-2 per post, not in professional sections)

**Hashtag Strategy**
- 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end of the post
- Mix of broad (#AIAutomation) and niche (#Zapier, #n8n)
- Don't use hashtags in the body of a post (looks spammy)
- Research which tags your audience follows

**Engagement Elements**
- End with a question to encourage comments
- Ask for specific input: "What challenges are you tackling in 2026?"
- Invite discussion: "Share your experiences below"
- Make engagement easy (yes/no questions, multiple choice)

**Link Strategy**
- Link in comments, not post body (better LinkedIn algorithm performance)
- Exception: When the link is the point of the post
- Use link preview when available
- Include a clear CTA to check comments for the link

### Substack Notes

**Max Length**
- Aim for 280 characters when possible (Twitter-like)
- Can go longer for mini-insights (up to 500 characters)
- Rarely exceed that; use the newsletter for longer thoughts

**Content Types**

**Quick Tips**
- Single actionable insight
- Framework or philosophy
- Example: "Before solving problems with AI, make sure you're solving the RIGHT problems."

**Behind-the-Scenes**
- Struggles with current builds
- Unexpected errors or delays
- Real-time problem-solving
- Example: "Small coffee shop yesterday: out of lunch ingredients by 2 pm, lots of leftover cake. My AI-obsessed brain immediately started optimising..."

**Philosophical Observations**
- Reflections on the AI/automation industry
- Challenges to conventional wisdom
- Thoughtful takes on trends
- Example: "I don't really like the term 'AI slop'. Not because it doesn't exist; there's plenty of it online. But the term makes it sound like AI is the problem, when it's really just a tool."

**Newsletter Promotion**
- Teasers for upcoming posts
- Key quotes from the latest post
- Questions that will be answered in the newsletter
- Never just "New post up!" (add value in the Note itself)

**Community Engagement**
- Responses to other Substackers' Notes
- Restacks with added insight
- Recommendations of other creators
- Questions for the community
- Celebration of subscriber milestones or feedback

**Tone**
- More casual than the newsletter
- Authentic and vulnerable
- Conversational
- Can be more frequent with emoji (but still not excessive)

## Topics & Terminology

### Preferred Terms
- "Automation" over "agentic workflows" (unless specifically discussing agents)
- "Workflow" over "pipeline" (more accessible)
- "Testing" over "experimenting" (implies rigour)
- "Real-world" or "in production" over "in theory"

### Avoid These Terms
- "Game-changer" (overused hype)
- "Revolutionary" (unless truly justified)
- "Hack" (implies shortcuts over solid solutions)
- "Crushing it" or similar productivity bro language
- "Leveraging" (use "using" instead)
- "Streamlining" (overused expression)

### Automation Platforms
- n8n (lowercase, not N8N)
- Make (capital M, formerly Integromat)
- Zapier (capital Z)
- Claude (not Claude AI)
- ChatGPT or GPT-4 (specific model names)

### How to Discuss AI
- Be specific about models: "GPT-4", not just "ChatGPT"
- Acknowledge limitations openly
- Avoid anthropomorphising: "The model generated", not "Claude decided" (unless used for a humorous take)
- Be clear about what's AI-generated vs human-created in your content

- **Example:** "Not every 'problem' needs an AI solution"

### Transparency Posts (Failures/Learnings)
- **Tone:** Honest, self-aware, slightly humorous
- **Structure:** What happened → Why it happened → What I learnt
- **Detail Level:** Moderate; enough to be instructive
- **Example:** "8 Hours Lost: Why My 'Perfect' Setup Collapsed"

### Quick Tips (Notes, Short Posts)
- **Tone:** Casual, punchy, conversational
- **Structure:** Insight → Brief explanation or example
- **Detail Level:** Low; one key takeaway
- **Example:** "Small coffee shop yesterday: out of lunch ingredients by 2 pm..."

2. Document as you go (screenshots, error messages, time spent)
3. Note costs incurred and resources used
4. Track metrics (before/after, time saved, error rates)

### Drafting Phase
1. Start with an outline matching the content pillar structure and series structure
2. Write the "what actually happened" story first
3. Add technical details and instructions
4. Layer in personality, humour, and voice
5. Include specific examples and metrics
6. Separate into 4-5 connected posts to form a series covering one experiment

### Editing Phase
1. Check for clarity (would an intermediate user understand?)
2. Verify all technical details are accurate and complete
3. Tighten language (remove unnecessary words)
4. Add headers and formatting for scannability
5. Read aloud to check flow and rhythm
6. Run through the quality checklist

### Platform Adaptation Phase
1. Newsletter version: full detail and story
2. LinkedIn version: key insight + hook + engagement question
3. Substack Notes: 3-5 quick takeaways or behind-the-scenes moments
4. Save all versions in the outputs directory with clear naming

## Final Note on Voice Consistency

The Savvy Sloth voice should feel like:
- A knowledgeable friend sharing what they learnt the hard way
- A researcher reporting findings honestly, not a guru dispensing wisdom
- Someone figuring things out alongside you, not above you
- A practical guide focused on what actually works

It should NOT feel like:
- A marketing pitch for AI tools
- An academic paper (too formal)
- A tech bro flexing success (too boastful)
- A cautionary tale against AI (too negative)

When in doubt, ask: "Would I trust this person's recommendation? Would I want to grab coffee with them to learn more?" If yes, you're on brand. If no, revisit the tone.
