Not every "problem" needs an AI solution.

Yesterday at a local coffee shop, my AI-obsessed brain kicked into overdrive. They'd run out of lunch ingredients by 2 pm and had mountains of leftover cake 🍰.

I immediately started designing solutions: demand forecasting, inventory optimisation, revenue maximisation ...

But then I noticed something interesting.

The owner was brilliantly improvising new dishes with whatever ingredients remained. The staff were laughing, sharing cake and about to close early to enjoy their Friday afternoon.

Sure, an optimisation workflow could have:  
• Reduced waste  
• Better matched supply with demand  
• Increased revenue

But it would also have removed:  
• Spontaneous, creative menu innovations  
• Joyful moments with the team over cake  
• An unexpected early Friday finish

Moral of the story: Don’t automate for automation’s sake. Define the RIGHT problem before building ANY solution.

Ask yourself:  
→ What am I actually trying to achieve?  
→ What might I lose in the process?  
→ Is this problem really worth solving?

What challenges are you tackling in 2026? Share them below; I'd love to discuss whether automation is the right answer (or not).
