Read the structured brief for "[IDEA TITLE]" in ideas/content-ideas.md.
 
Read brand-guidelines.md for voice and formatting rules, and substack_post_seriesX_partX samples from writing-samples folder for typical structure of the part, voice, and tone.

Write the complete Substack newsletter post for the part X of 5-part series on my build of content creator agent following this structure:
- Use the opening hook from the brief (expand if needed)
- Follow the 1,500-2,500 word target length (can be shorter if needed)
- Use British English spelling throughout
- Include specific metrics and real details
- Break dense technical sections with 1-2 sentence paragraphs
- Add headers using #### for major sections, ##### for subsections
- Write in my voice: honest, practical, slightly self-deprecating
- End with the standard CTA and sign-off from brand-guidelines.md
