Read the structured brief for "[IDEA TITLE]" in ideas/content-ideas.md and rough notes from raw-notes.md related to the brief.
 
Read brand-guidelines.md for voice and formatting rules, product-marketing-context.md for the Savvy Sloth brand context, seo-best-practices.md for SEO guidance, and substack_post_series*_part* samples from writing-samples folder for the typical structure of the part, voice, and tone.

Write the complete Substack newsletter post for part X of the 5-part series on my build of a content creator agent following this structure:
- Use the opening hook from the brief (expand if needed)
- Follow the 1,500-2,500 word target length (can be shorter or longer if needed)
- Use British English spelling throughout
- Include specific metrics and real details
- Break dense technical sections with 1-2 sentence paragraphs
- Add headers using #### for major sections, ##### for subsections
- Write in my voice: honest, practical, slightly self-deprecating
- End with the standard CTA and sign-off from brand-guidelines.md

Part X should focus on [FOCUS OF THE POST].
