I don’t really like the term “AI slop”.

Not because it doesn’t exist; there’s plenty of it online. But the term makes it sound like AI is the problem, when it’s really just a tool.

Say a plumber botches a job. You don’t say a wrench ruined your pipes, and now you need to fix the wrench’s mess. You say you need to fix the *plumber’s* mess.

AI doesn’t just decide to flood the internet with low-effort, low-quality content. We do.

And that’s a *people* problem, not an AI problem.
