What a week it’s been. It’s hard to believe that so much can happen in a week, but here we are:

Savvy Sloth has hit its first milestone of 50 subscribers (and we’re actually at 60 now\!) \- thank you again to each and every one of you 🥳\!

Somebody as big as [Dr Sam Illingworth](https://substack.com/profile/253722705-dr-sam-illingworth) reached out about the collaboration 😍 – I still cannot fully believe it, but I look forward to it\!

Had amazing [Karen Smiley](https://substack.com/profile/211311675-karen-smiley) reach out about being added to [SheWritesAI](https://substack.com/profile/354270628-shewritesai) directory – I am so honoured and excited to become part of the community\!

Bing read loads of posts about automation from [Sahin](https://substack.com/profile/420762889-sahin) (he’s not technically writing on Substack, but has a newsletter on Beehive, which I highly recommend)

Went down the rabbit hole of watching endless videos of LLMs talking to each other, courtesy of [AI Meets Girlboss](https://substack.com/profile/415027717-ai-meets-girlboss) 🤣

And much more behind the scenes. Thank you all for making Substack a welcoming corner of the internet\!
