Read skills/ideas-transformer/SKILL.md carefully.

Then read these context files in order:
1. product-marketing-context.md
2. brand-guidelines.md  
3. seo-best-practices.md
4. writing-samples folder
5. ideas/content-ideas.md

Then read ideas/raw-notes.md.

Transform all raw notes into structured content briefs following the 
SKILL.md instructions exactly. Save the output to ideas/content-ideas.md, 
appending to existing content (don't overwrite).

After saving, give me a 3-sentence summary of what was processed.
