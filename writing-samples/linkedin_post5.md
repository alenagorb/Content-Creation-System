So I got made redundant a week ago, and instead of immediately job hunting, I've decided to run an experiment.

I've been seeing a lot of people across social media platforms boasting about how AI saved them a ton of money, time, unicorn tears, you name it, and the question that keeps lingering in my head is, "Would this work for me? If I do that, would I also get the same results?"

So, I am starting a newsletter dedicated to researching and assessing the latest AI tools and automations and reporting back on whether they're worth your time. And it's called Savvy Sloth (because working smarter \> working harder, but also the logo came out cute, and I'm committed now)\!

Full transparency, I am using an army of LLMs to help me test whether AI is useful, so the irony is not lost on me. But hey, that's part of the experiment, right?

The first issue will drop this Friday, so if you would like to show your support and follow along, you can subscribe here: [https://lnkd.in/eKP\_MjSn](https://lnkd.in/eKP_MjSn)

And if you have any processes that could benefit from automation or solutions you'd like to see researched and tested, leave them in the comments or DM me.
