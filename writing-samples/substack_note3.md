Great piece from [Sienna](https://substack.com/profile/429451512-sienna)\! I think that's a very important conversation for writers to have, especially now. I saw a few people "calling out" others for using AI in writing.

I use AI in my writing and creatives a lot, but I use it strategically. AI doesn't write my posts for me, but it helps me with proofreading, editing, tightening my language, improving clarity, removing repetition, and so much more.

The thoughts, ideas, and results are still my own – AI doesn't generate those for me, but it helps me to add clarity to better communicate those to the world.

But just like with any other tool, you need to know how to use it effectively.
