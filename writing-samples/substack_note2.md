Small coffee shop yesterday: out of lunch ingredients by 2 pm, lots of leftover cake.

My AI-obsessed brain immediately started optimising: demand forecasting, inventory algorithms, revenue models...

Then I watched:

* Owner creating new dishes on the fly  
* Staff laughing, eating leftover cake together  
* Everyone heading home early on Friday

Could inventory optimisation have reduced waste and boosted revenue? Sure.

But it would also have erased creativity, laughter, and an early Friday finish.
