Hot take: You don’t need complicated 7-paragraph prompts to get good results from ChatGPT.

I've been seeing so many LinkedIn posts promising “the perfect Fortune-500-CEO-executive-briefing-style prompt that saved me 20 hours a week”… (if you comment a MAGIC WORD, of course 🙃)

Here’s the thing:

If you’re spending 2 hours crafting a prompt to summarise 5 articles, you could’ve just… summarised the articles.

I’ve been using ChatGPT daily to build automations, analyse pharma/biotech content, write emails, and now build out my Savvy Sloth projects, and honestly:

90% of my prompts look NOTHING like this:

“You are an expert in \[industry\] with 20 years’ experience…  
here are 10 examples…  
here are 47 constraints…  
please follow the tone of a McKinsey partner…”

Instead, most of my prompts look like this:

“Here’s the document (pdf attached). Can you please summarise it and tell me which part is relevant to this section? \[paste short excerpt\]”

Takes 60 seconds.

Works nearly every time.

And if not? I just ask a follow-up.

Now, don't get me wrong, complex, structured prompts do have their place.  
I used those in my pharma/biotech funding tracker automation (dropping this week 🚀). They're great for repeatable workflows or when you need very specific formatting.

But for most everyday tasks? They’re overkill.

If you need a summary, just ask for one.  
If you need ideas, ask for ideas.  
Start simple. Add complexity if needed.

The whole point of AI chatbots is to make your life easier, not to turn you into a “god-tier” prompt engineer.

This week's challenge: try asking ChatGPT your next question like you'd ask a real person. See what happens.

What's your go-to ChatGPT prompt style? Do you use those long "expert role" prompts or keep it simple? Let me know in the comments.
