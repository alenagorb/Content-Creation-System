This is such an important point for reflection from [Dr Sam Illingworth](https://substack.com/profile/253722705-dr-sam-illingworth) [Mia Kiraki 🎭](https://substack.com/profile/362428399-mia-kiraki) [Dallas Payne](https://substack.com/profile/324339337-dallas-payne) [Marcela Distefano](https://substack.com/profile/65239294-marcela-distefano) [Goodnex](https://substack.com/profile/147433691-goodnex) [AI Meets Girlboss](https://substack.com/profile/415027717-ai-meets-girlboss) [Carolina Wilke](https://substack.com/profile/262727079-carolina-wilke) and [Laura O'Driscoll](https://substack.com/profile/360351375-laura-odriscoll)\!

I was scrolling through the comments on LinkedIn the other day and honestly thought I was going crazy for a minute – there were so many very eloquent comments, but when I actually read them, they were just summaries of the post.

I personally don't mind if the comment contains an em dash or "rule of 3" or "X not Y" or other "typical" AI features (I actually started using em dashes after using AI in writing, and I love it\!), but I do mind when it's all just style without any substance. It looks strange to me, and I'm writing about AI & automation\!

As many of the authors noted, AI should help us enhance our connections and express ourselves. But AI-generated comments just feel like we're trying to automate the humanity out of ourselves.
